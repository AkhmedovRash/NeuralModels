# NeuralModels
'''
This code imports several libraries such as numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib, gensim, os, pandas, time, nltk,
pymorphy2. Then, several functions are defined that perform various operations, such as reading text from a 
file, processing text, obtaining index sequences, creating neural models, and others. Also in the code there 
is the use of loaded models and work with data, such as data arrays and text sequences.
