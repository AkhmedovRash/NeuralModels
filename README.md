# NeuralModels
'''
This project reads contract text files, cleans and lemmatizes them, converts them into sequences of tokens, and predicts structural section labels (S1â€“S6) for each token. It supports three architectures:
Conv1D baseline
UNet-style 1D CNN
PSPNet-style 1D CNN
The goal is to segment and classify text into meaningful contract sections automatically.

Features:
Russian text preprocessing with punctuation removal and pymorphy2 lemmatization.
Custom Word2Vec embeddings trained directly on your contract corpus.
Sliding window sequence generation for sequence labeling.
Multiple architectures for experimentation:
Conv1D
UNet (1D)
PSPNet (1D)
Per-section and overall accuracy evaluation.
